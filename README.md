Laniakea Engine is a lightweight, modular C++ engine for real-time rendering and simulation, featuring a custom-built Entity-Component-System (ECS). Designed with performance and scalability in mind, it serves as a foundation for 3D applications and game development. The project is currently a work in progress.
