Laniakea Engine is a lightweight, modular C++ engine for real-time rendering and simulation, featuring a custom-built Entity-Component-System (ECS). 

The project is currently a work in progress.

Tried technologies:
- Custom event system for processing messages in the engine.
- Separation of the engine into modules in the form of separate DLL libraries and project compilation in different configurations using a custom cmake script.
- Testing of the entire project and individual libraries using the gtest library.
